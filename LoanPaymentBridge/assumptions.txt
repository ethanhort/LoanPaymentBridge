ASSUMPTIONS: 

Program knows where to begin reading data ...
	-Program begins reading data from row 10 of excel report. If first entry in table is not on row 10, delete/add empty rows to compensate
		-first entry meaning first row of excel file containing a principal and/or interest amount

Program knows where to stop reading data ...
	-Program continues to read data from excel file until there is empty cell in "Loan Group" column.
		-if loan group column skips a cell or has a value immediately under final entry, program will break
			-adjust excel file as necessary to accomodate this  

Loan Group is in column C of excel report
	-if this changes, change the LOAN_GROUP_INDEX constant at beginning of LoanPaymentBridge.java to appropriate value
		-remember computers start counting at 0 so column C=2, column D=3, etc
		
Principal is in column H of excel report
	-if this changes, fix in the same manner as above except change PRINCIPAL_INDEX constant instead
	
Interest is in column I of excel report
	-if this changes, fix in the same manner as above except change INTEREST_INDEX constant instead

For last 3 issues, could also swap positions of columns in excel file to fix without having to dig through code
